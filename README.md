# Fraudulent-Review-Detection-Using-ML
## 📌 Fake Review Detection using Machine Learning

Fake reviews have become a major concern in e-commerce platforms, as they can mislead customers and damage brand trust. This project focuses on building a Machine Learning-based system to detect whether a review is genuine or fake by analyzing its textual content.

🔍 Project Overview

Collected review data (genuine and fake samples).
Performed data preprocessing: text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF/Bag of Words).
Trained multiple Machine Learning algorithms:
-Logistic Regression
-Naive Bayes
-Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The best-performing model can be used to classify new/unseen reviews.

🎯 Objectives

Identify fake/spam reviews effectively.
Help customers make better decisions while shopping online.
Assist e-commerce platforms in maintaining trustworthiness.
